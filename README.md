Assembly Project - Lego Baseball Pitching machine
Contributors: Andrew Choi, Peter Han

A pitching machine & video game using Assembly, LEGO, and a VGA monitor. The project uses various LEGO sensors to detect whether there is a ball in the machine, if there is, the machine starts throwing the ball at two different velocities (Random). There are additional sensors to detect whether the batter has hit the ball, or whether it was a strike. If the ball is hit, the sensors detect the type of hit (single, double, triple, home run) and the baserunners move around the bases on VGA screen. The VGA also shows the current difficulty level (slow, fast, random), number of strikes, and the points scored by batter.
